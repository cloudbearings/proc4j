Java library for OS process management. Supports Mac OS, Windows, Linux and Solaris. The library can read process list, send a signals to processes, obtain various information about processes (cpu load, memory usage, free memory, thread count, etc.)

The library uses jni to access OS specific API.

Library is under development now (see project roadmap: http://code.google.com/p/proc4j/wiki/ProjectRoadmap), so not all of mentioned features are implemented and working correctly. Maintainers are welcome.
